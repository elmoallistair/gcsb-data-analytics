# Activity: Design a data lifecycle plan

## Scenario : 

You’ve been hired as a cloud data analyst at TheLook eCommerce, a global company that sells clothing products through physical stores and digital channels, 
including their own website, mobile app, and various third-party social media apps. TheLook eCommerce has been growing quickly thanks to the company’s wide 
variety of clothing styles, innovative practices, and commitment to ethical and sustainable sourcing.

To handle the rapidly growing amount of data they need to analyze, TheLook eCommerce data team has prioritized the development of a comprehensive data lifecycle 
plan that ensures secure and effective data management. To support that goal, you recently met with key stakeholders in the merchandising and marketing departments. 
During that meeting, the stakeholders identifed key business questions they need answered to make effective data-driven decision-making. They also shared their 
current data usage patterns and concerns.

Based on that information, you’ve been asked to identify recommendations to improve the current data lifecycle plan. The goal for that plan is to ensure data is 
effectively managed throughout its lifecycle and that data is accessible to the stakeholders for decision-making.

First, you’ll align the stakeholders' key business questions with the desired outcomes. Doing so will clarify what specific data you need to gather and analyze 
to address their needs.

Next, you’ll use the stakeholder information to identify the specific data you need to gather and analyze. This task will enable you to recommend suitable data 
sources, identify potential data gaps, and suggest any necessary transformations to fulfill the stakeholders' needs.

Finally, you’ll review the stakeholder feedback and outline recommendations for data management, analysis, usage, and eventual destruction to complete the data 
lifecycle plan.


### TASK 1 : PLANNING

Business Question : Which products are most often purchased together?
> Objective       : Increase sales of related products by 10% over the next six months by bundling items most often purchased together.
> Data Needed     : Items purchased by customers during the same transaction over the last six months.

Business Question : Which products are selling the most?
> Objective       : Increase sales of top-selling items by 15% by ranking the top 100 items by sales volume in the past 30 days and prioritize the marketing of those items.
> Data Needed     : Sales volume for each items purchased in last 30 days, get the top 100 items.

Business Question : How can we use point of sale data to better manage inventory? 
> Objective       : Reduce the number of out-of-stock items by 10% by connecting POS (point-of-sale) data with warehouse data to identify when inventory is running low.
> Data Needed     : Latest POS and warehouse data

Business Question : How can we determine which countries have the most visitors to our website?
> Objective       : Increase brand awareness by 10% in the five countries with the most visitors as identified by website traffic.
> Data Needed     : Number of visitor / web traffic for each country in the last six months.


### TASK 2 : CAPTURE DATA

Data Sources
- The POS dataset is used by marketing and merchandising to track sales.
- Web analytics data is used by both marketing and merchandising to track traffic to the site and monitor the success of products and campaigns.
- The POS dataset stores data on every item ordered by a customer in a single transaction.
- The web analytics data tracks the number of visitors by page and the visitors' location.

Gaps
- Since the POS data is not connected to the warehouse data, it's hard to know when we need to restock.

Data Transformation
- The POS data collects sales in the local currency, but it is difficult to compare sales from different countries.
- The marketing team would like the web analytics results filtered to focus on specific countries where they currently have ads running.

Recommendations
> POS data needs to be integrated with warehouse data in real-time to effectively monitor and update inventory levels, helping to reduce out-of-stock situations. 
  The system should also send alerts when stock hits a certain threshold.
> The sales data collected can be converted into the same currency, such as USD. This will make it easier to compare sales across different countries. 
  Additionally, we can consider normalizing the data by accounting for the purchasing power in each country.
> Running country-based ads is recommended due to the different cultures, customer behaviour and purchasing power levels in each country. 
  Continuous monitoring is also necessary to ensure that our campaigns are effective.


### TASK 3 : 

Manage
- The POS information collects credit card information.
- The current policy on who should have access to PII (personally identifiable information), like credit card information, is unclear.

Analyze
- The marketing team relies on a web traffic report that lists the total amount of traffic for the top five countries. This information should be updated daily.
- The merchandising team would like a clear and insightful visualization to understand how customers purchase products together.

Archive and Destroy
- We shouldn't hold on to PII forever. We need a plan for when to destroy the data.
- While most web analytics data is not actively referenced beyond six months, the marketing team occasionally requires historical data up to five years for specific 
  campaigns or trends analysis.

Recommendations
> When collecting PII informations such as credit card, make sure to masking the data for privacy. Access to PII data should be governed by clear policies, 
  allowing access only to authorized personnel. Additionally, PII data should be stored securely with encryption and access controls, and it should be deleted when 
  no longer needed.
> The marketing team needs an automated system to retrieve daily reports of web traffic in each country and upload the historical data into a database. 
  The database should be connected directly to business intelligence tools such as Looker or BigQuery for further analysis and visualization. The older historical data
  can be archieved.
